            The year has cycled around and we are into the season of the approach of our Annual
            General Meeting <strong>(AGM 9 September).</strong>
            The first step towards it is to establish the Nominating Team who are tasked with gathering
            a list of people to serve on the Leadership Team. We will need four people because we
            have the expected rotation loss of members, and two people have left. Lily Han returned to
            China and Jessie Liu is now at university in Australia. Christo John and Lorraine Francis are
            the remaining team. Please prayerfully consider this ministry and who can serve.

    <p>
      <sup>1</sup>Give thanks to the LORD , for he is good; his love endures forever.<br >
      <sup>2</sup>Let the redeemed of the LORD tell their story - those he redeemed from the hand of the foe,<br />
      <sup>3</sup>those he gathered from the lands, from east and west, from north and south.<br />

    <strong>Psalm 107:17-22 (NIV)</strong><br />
    <p>
        <sup>17</sup>Some became fools through their rebellious ways and suffered affliction because of their iniquities.<br />
        <sup>18</sup>They loathed all food and drew near the gates of death.<br />
        <sup>19</sup>Then they cried to the L ORD in their trouble, and he saved them from their distress.<br />
        <sup>20</sup>He sent out his word and healed them; he rescued them from the grave.<br />
        <sup>21</sup>Let them give thanks to the L ORD for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.<br />
        <sup>13</sup>Let them sacrifice thank offerings and tell of his works with songs of joy.<br />

<strong>LENT BIBLE STUDY: You are invited to stay after morning worship on Palm Sunday,
25 th March and join in a Bible Study. We will conclude by sharing a light lunch
together.</strong> We will be following the Lectio Divina method of group study. Our passage
will be Mark 14:32-42.
</p>
<p>
  The Lectio Divinia study method below is what we have followed at St Johns previously with
  Chris Skinner:<br >
  <em>
    Choose a significant Gospel passage<br >
    Read passage through out loud (by a good reader)<br >
    After a short time participants speak aloud a key phrase or word that particularly struck
    them. There is no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
    The passage is read again slowly and meaningfully
    In groups of four to six, participants share on the passage and their significant word or
    phrase. Again no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
    Return to larger group. Some may wish to share in the larger group. Provide some time for
    this.
  </em>

<p><strong>A MESSAGE FROM THE METHODIST CHURCH</strong></p>
<p>We ask parishes to pray for a moratorium on new oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>We see <strong>action on climate change</strong> as essential for caring for our common home, and our
global neighbours. Climate justice is part of our commitment to peace and stewarding our
resources responsibly for future generations.</p>
<p>Let us urge the government to refrain from block offers for new oil and gas exploration. We
are concerned that offers for new oil and gas exploration could be made at the Petroleum
Industry Conference 26<sup>th</sup> March.</p>
<p>Please write to Hon Megan Woods, Minister for Energy and Resources, to Prime Minister
Ardern and Hon James Shaw, Minister for Climate Change to request an end to new oil and
gas exploration. A draft letter is being circulated to Parish secretaries.</p>
<p>The <em>Climate Conversations</em> Resource is available as hard copy on the Public Questions
website http://www.methodist.org.nz/public_questions_network/index3</p>

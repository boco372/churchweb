    <sup>10</sup>
    Finally, be strong in the Lord and in his mighty power. <sup>11</sup> Put on the full armor of
    God, so that you can take your stand against the devil’s schemes. <sup>12</sup> For our struggle
    is not against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against
    the powers of this dark world and against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly
    realms. <sup>13</sup> Therefore put on the full armor of God, so that when the day of evil comes,
    you may be able to stand your ground, and after you have done everything, to
    stand. <sup>14</sup> Stand firm then, with the belt of truth buckled around your waist, with the
    breastplate of righteousness in place, <sup>15</sup> and with your feet fitted with the readiness
    that comes from the gospel of peace. <sup>16</sup> In addition to all this, take up the shield of
    faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming arrows of the evil one. <sup>17</sup> Take
    the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. <sup>18</sup> And
    pray in the Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests. With this in
    mind, be alert and always keep on praying for all the Lord’s people. <sup>19</sup> Pray also for
    me, that whenever I speak, words may be given me so that I will fearlessly make
    known the mystery of the gospel, <sup>20</sup> for which I am an ambassador in chains. Pray
    that I may declare it fearlessly, as I should.

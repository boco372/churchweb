            <p><strong>David and Goliath</strong></p>
            <strong>17</strong> Now the Philistines gathered their forces for war and assembled at Sokoh in Judah.
            They pitched camp at Ephes Dammim, between Sokohand Azekah. <sup>2</sup> Saul and the
            Israelites assembled and camped in the Valley of Elah and drew up their battle line to
            meet the Philistines. <sup>3</sup> The Philistines occupied one hill and the Israelites another, with
            the valley between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>4</sup> A champion named Goliath, who was from Gath, came out of the Philistine camp. His
            height was six cubits and a span. <sup>5</sup> He had a bronze helmet on his head and wore a
            coat of scale armor of bronze weighing five thousand shekels ; <sup>6</sup> on his legs he wore
            bronze greaves, and a bronze javelin was slung on his back. <sup>7</sup> His spear shaft was like a
            weaver’s rod, and its iron point weighed six hundred shekels. His shield bearer went
            ahead of him.
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> Goliath stood and shouted to the ranks of Israel, “Why do you come out and line up
            for battle? Am I not a Philistine, and are you not the servants of Saul? Choose a man
            and have him come down to me. <sup>9</sup> If he is able to fight and kill me, we will become
            your subjects; but if I overcome him and kill him, you will become our subjects and
            serve us.”

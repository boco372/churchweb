        <p>
          When Abram was ninety-nine years old, the LORD appeared to him and said, “I am God Almighty; walk before me faithfully and be blameless.
          <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;Then I will make my covenant between me and you and will greatly increase your numbers."
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;Abram fell facedown, and God said to him,
          <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;“As for me, this is my covenant with you: You will be the father of many nations.
          <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;No longer will you be called Abram; your name will be Abraham, for I have made you a father of many nations.
          <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;I will make you very fruitful; I will make nations of you, and kings will come from you.
          <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;I will establish my covenant as an everlasting covenant between me and you and your descendants after you for the generations to come, to be your God and the God of your descendants after you.
        </p>
        <p>
        <strong>Genesis 17:15-16 New International Version (NIV)</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>15</sup>&nbsp;God also said to Abraham, “As for Sarai your wife, you are no longer to call her Sarai; her name will be Sarah.
          <sup>16</sup>&nbsp;I will bless her and will surely give you a son by her. I will bless her so that she will be the mother of nations; kings of peoples will come from her.”

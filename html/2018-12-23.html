    <strong>
        Mary Visits Elizabeth
    </strong>
    <br />
    <sup>39</sup>At that time Mary got ready and hurried to a town in the hill country of
    Judea, <sup>40</sup> where she entered Zechariah’s home and greeted Elizabeth.<br />
    <sup>41></sup>When Elizabeth heard Mary’s greeting, the baby leaped in her womb, and
    Elizabeth was filled with the Holy Spirit. <sup>42</sup> In a loud voice she exclaimed:
    “Blessed are you among women, and blessed is the child you will bear! <sup>43</sup> But
    why am I so favoured, that the mother of my Lord should come to me? <sup>44</sup> As
    soon as the sound of your greeting reached my ears, the baby in my womb
    leaped for joy. <sup>45</sup> Blessed is she who has believed that the Lord would fulfil his
    promises to her!”

<strong>
        Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team met with the Church Partners on Tuesday night, the 11<sup>th</sup> Dec. Of the
eleven members, ten were able to attend and following briefings from the three Partner
Church Representatives a vote was held to determine our Coordinating Partner (to be
called Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on.<br >
The result was a substantial majority vote for the Anglican Church to take this role.
In due course Archdeacon Michael Berry will take up the management role for the Anglican
Church. As a consequence his responsibility will include guidance in the process for
appointment of a minister, overseeing the daily running of the church, as well as offering
pulpit supply on Sundays. He may appoint someone on his behalf.<br />
<br />
Although the Anglican Church now has the role of overseeing the vacancy, it does not
confine the selection of a future appointee to come from that denomination. St Johns can
broaden its outlook to find the best considered candidate from any of the three partner
Churches and beyond.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please ask any member of the Leadership Team.<br />

<strong>Kindy Playground update:</strong> Over the Christmas period we will be re-covering the downstairs
playground black matting with an artificial grass. We are installing a drain along the edge of
the concrete pathway. We will be removing the fixed climbing equipment. We are
negotiating with Kindy about a plan to create a seating area and bark ground cover of 4.3
by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree. Lorraine

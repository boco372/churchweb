        The Magi Visit the Messiah
    </strong>
    <br />
    <strong>2</strong> After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea, during the time of King
Herod, Magi from the east came to Jerusalem <sup>2</sup> and asked, “Where is
the one who has been born king of the Jews? We saw his star when it
rose and have come to worship him.” ...<br />
<sup>9</sup>
After they had heard the king, they went on their way, and the star
they had seen when it rose went ahead of them until it stopped over
the place where the child was.<br />
<sup>10</sup>
When they saw the star, they were overjoyed.<br />
<sup>11</sup>
On coming to the house, they saw the child with his mother Mary,
and they bowed down and worshiped him. Then they opened their
treasures and presented him with gifts of gold, frankincense and myrrh.<br />
<sup>12</sup>
And having been warned in a dream not to go back to Herod, they
returned to their country by another route.<br />

<strong>
    Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team met with the Church Partners on Tuesday night, the 11<sup>th</sup> Dec. Of the
eleven members, ten were able to attend and following briefings from the three Partner
Church Representatives a vote was held to determine our <strong>Coordinating Partner</strong> (to be
called Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on.<br >
The result was a substantial majority vote for the <strong>Anglican</strong> Church to take this role.
In due course Archdeacon Michael Berry will take up the management role for the Anglican
Church. As a consequence his responsibility will include guidance in the process for
appointment of a minister, overseeing the daily running of the church, as well as offering
pulpit supply on Sundays. He may appoint someone on his behalf.<br />
<br />
Although the Anglican Church now has the role of overseeing the vacancy, it does not
confine the selection of a future appointee to come from that denomination. St Johns can
broaden its outlook to find the best considered candidate from any of the three partner
Churches and beyond.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please ask any member of the Leadership Team.<br />

    On Sunday 6th of January we will be baptising the following people from our
    Mandarin congregation: Sofia Liu, Mei Xiang Chen, Sha Sha Kang, Xiang Bing
    Zhang, Li Xing Pan and welcoming them into Church membership.<br />
    It has been a blessing to accept them as Baptismal candidates, to see their
    determination to become one in Christ, their nervousness as they recognise the
    level of commitment and the joy of their excitement. Pray for them as they begin
    this faith journey. Lorraine

<strong>Kindergarten Playground update:</strong><br />
Over the Christmas period we will be re-covering the downstairs
playground black matting with an artificial grass. We are installing a drain along the edge of
the concrete pathway.<br />
 We will be removing the fixed climbing equipment. We are
negotiating with the kindergarten about a plan to create a seating area and bark ground cover of 4.3
by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree. Lorraine

<strong>
    Hall Kitchen Update
</strong>
We have a tiler coming in early January to install splashback tiles
around the stoves. This is the last of the renovations, leaving only the task of findingsuitable large plates to replace our light brown speckled ones. The Light brown plates are
too big for the bottom drawer of the dishwasher, so we are replacing them.

<hr />
<strong>The Francis-Dittmers are leaving</strong><br />
Lorraine’s last day with us will be Sunday the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February. The combined service will be
followed by our farewell to Lorraine and family, and a shared lunch to follow. It is fourteen
and a half years since they joined us, we have enjoyed significant participation of the family
in our church life.<br />
In recognition of the service to St Johns, a presentation will be offered to Lorraine on the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
of February. If you would like to contribute towards a gift, please make a donation in a
plain envelope with Lorraine written on the outside, and place in the offering or deliver to
the church office.<br />
Thank you. Alan Vickers, Session Clerk<br />

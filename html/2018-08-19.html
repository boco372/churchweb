  <sup>15</sup> See then that ye walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise,<br />
  <sup>16</sup> Redeeming the time, because the days are evil.<br />
  <sup>17</sup> Wherefore be ye not unwise, but understanding what the will of the  Lord is. <br />
  <sup>18</sup> And be not drunk with wine, wherein is excess; but be filled with the Spirit; <br />
  <sup>19</sup> Speaking to yourselves in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord;<br />
  <sup>20</sup> Giving  thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name  of our Lord Jesus Christ;

        Luke 3:15-17, 21-22
    </strong>
    <br />
    15 The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if
    John might possibly be the Messiah. 16 John answered them all, “I baptize you
    with water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose
    sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.
    17 His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the
    wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”
<br />
    21 When all the people were being baptized, Jesus was baptized too. And as he
    was praying, heaven was opened 22 and the Holy Spirit descended on him in bodily
    form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven: “You are my Son, whom I love;
    with you I am well pleased.”

    Brenda Ryan and Mary Hall for good health. For the families of both
Loas Toung and Joyce Leach as they mourn the loss of a loved one. For two people, one to
be our Presbyterian representative and another to be our second Anglican representative.
Prayer for both St Johns and Lorraine (and family) as we move into this time of change.
Please pray for an increase in enrolments for Little Cubs Kindy.

<strong>
    Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team has determined that our <strong>Coordinating Partner</strong> (to be called
Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on is the Anglican Church.<br >

Archdeacon Michael Berry has informed us that Archdeacon Carole Hughes is going to
manage this process as all the current vacancies in this diocese are in Michael’s region and
he needs to share the workload. They are working on identifying a priest for the interim
and will inform us as soon as they can. It is standard Anglican practice to do nothing in a
parish until the incumbent has actually left.<br />

    Kindergarten playground update
</strong>
Please go and have a look at the children’s playground downstairs. We have had the black
matting re-covered with artificial grass. We have had a drain installed along the edge of the
concrete pathway. The fixed climbing equipment has been removed and a seating area has
been created with bark ground cover of 4.3 by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree.

        We have had a tiler install splashback tiles around the
stoves. Thank you Felicity for the donation of the tiles. All
that is left of our kitchen renovations is the task of finding
suitable large plates to replace our light brown speckled
ones. The light brown plates are too big for the bottom
draw<strong>er</strong> of the dishwasher, so we are replacing them.

<strong>The Francis-Dittmers are leaving</strong><br />
Lorraine’s last day with us will be Sunday the 3<sup>rd</sup> of February. The combined service will be
followed by our farewell to Lorraine and family, and a shared lunch to follow. It is fourteen
and a half years since they joined us, we have enjoyed significant participation of the family
in our church life.<br />
In recognition of the service to St Johns, a presentation will be offered to Lorraine on the 3<sup>rd</sup> 
of February. If you would like to contribute towards a gift, please make a donation in a
plain envelope with Lorraine written on the outside, and place in the offering or deliver to
the church office.<br />
Thank you. Alan Vickers, Session Clerk<br />

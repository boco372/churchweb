        Mark 16:1-8 Jesus Has Risen<br />
        1 When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James,
        and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body. <sup>2</sup> Very
        early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to
        the tomb <sup>3</sup> and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the
        entrance of the tomb?” <sup>4</sup> But when they looked up, they saw that the stone,
        which was very large, had been rolled away. <sup>5</sup>5 As they entered the tomb, they
        saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they
        were alarmed. <sup>6</sup> “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the
        Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where
        they laid him. <sup>7</sup> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you
        into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’ ” <sup>8</sup> Trembling and
        bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to
        anyone, because they were afraid.<br />

  <p><strong>Prayer Points: </strong>
    Brenda Ryan for good health; Dorothy Peiris who has fallen and hurt
her back; someone to pick up the ministry of looking after our IT system; Someone to be
our Financial Coordinator for our St Johns Finance Team, more students for the English
Language classes held at St Johns (we need a minimum of 12 students) please. 
  </p>
  <hr />
  <p>
      <strong>Thank You to </strong>Bob Williamson who will be standing down as our Financial Coordinator at
      the AGM. He has faithfully served St Johns in this capacity for 4 + years.
  </p>
  <p>
    He has led the Finance Team well, worked out the annual budgets, managed the annual
    audit requirements, given reports to the congregation when necessary, answered hundreds
    of finance related email questions, struggled with our Bank to achieve our goals... learnt
    about Xero, supported our office staff with all their financial work... He’s been just great
    and yes it is a unusual to be saying all this now – and yes it will be repeated at the AGM –
    but for us to pray for someone to pick up this role, you now know at least some the tasks
    that we’re praying another person will do for us.

    <strong>English Language Classes</strong> run by English Language Partners are free for NZ citizens.
    Currently (Term 1) they have stopped for Term 1. They need a minimum of 12
    students to get full government sponsorship. They currently only have 7, hence the
    prayer call for more students. The teacher is fully trained and really good. These
    classes are friendly, very practical and focus on helping students integrate into NZ
    society. We (St John’s) gain a little financially as they pay a rental for the hours on site,
    but by far the greatest gain is to have the friendly chatter, lots of people learning to
    know St Johns and people coming to church.

        Gallipoli to the Somme
     </strong>

Somme'. Jenny Wollerman (soprano), Jarvis Dams (baritone). Pipers Sinfonia
conducted by Uwe Grodd. Holy Trinity's resident organist Philip Smith will also play
two solo works by Leonce de Saint-Martin and Jeanne Demessieux.Anthony Ritchie's secular cantata Gallipoli to the Somme had a rapturous world
premiere last October in Dunedin, and has so far been broadcast twice on RNZ.
Against the backdrop of a horrific war, Ritchie celebrates the experiences of ordinary
people from their songs, diary entries, letters, and poems, all brought into irresistible
musical life. The Otago Daily Times reviewer was ecstatic. "After the final chord" she
said "complete silence held the audience before prolonged applause and a standing
ovation rewarded this brilliant new work". Tickets $56, concession available |

    <strong>
        John the Baptist Prepares the Way
    </strong>
<sup>1</sup> In the fifteenth year of the reign of Tiberius Caesar—when Pontius
Pilate was governor of Judea, Herod tetrarch of Galilee, his brother Philip tetrarch of Iturea and Traconitis,
and Lysanias tetrarch of Abilene— <sup>2</sup> during the high-priesthood of Annas and Caiaphas, the word of God came
to John son of Zechariah in the wilderness. <sup>3</sup> He went into all the country around the Jordan, preaching a
baptism of repentance for the forgiveness of sins. <sup>4</sup> As it is written in the book of the words of Isaiah the
prophet: “A voice of one calling in the wilderness, ‘Prepare the way for the Lord, make straight paths for him.
<sup>5</sup> Every valley shall be filled in, every mountain and hill made low. The crooked roads shall become straight,
the rough ways smooth. <sup>6</sup> And all people will see God’s salvation.’ ” <sup>7</sup> John said to the crowds coming out to
be baptized by him, “You brood of vipers! Who warned you to flee from the coming wrath? <sup>8</sup> Produce fruit in
keeping with repentance. And do not begin to say to yourselves, ‘We have Abraham as our father.’ For I tell
you that out of these stones God can raise up children for Abraham. <sup>9</sup> The ax is already at the root of the
trees, and every tree that does not produce good fruit will be cut down and thrown into the fire.” <sup>10</sup> “What
should we do then?” the crowd asked.
<sup>11</sup> John answered, “Anyone who has two shirts should share with the one who has none, and anyone who has
food should do the same.”
<sup>12</sup> Even tax collectors came to be baptized. “Teacher,” they asked, “what should we do?” <sup>13</sup> “Don’t collect
any more than you are required to,” he told them.
<sup>14</sup> Then some soldiers asked him, “And what should we do?” He replied, “Don’t extort money and don’t
accuse people falsely—be content with your pay.”
<sup>25</sup> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the
Messiah. <sup>16</sup> John answered them all, “I baptize you with water. But one who is more powerful than I will
come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and
fire. <sup>17</sup> His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but
he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.” <sup>18</sup> And with many other words John exhorted the people
and proclaimed the good news to them.<br />

<strong>
        Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team met with the Church Partners on Tuesday night, the 11<sup>th</sup> Dec. Of the
eleven members, ten were able to attend and following briefings from the three Partner
Church Representatives a vote was held to determine our Coordinating Partner (to be
called Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on.<br >
The result was a substantial majority vote for the Anglican Church to take this role.
In due course Archdeacon Michael Berry will take up the management role for the Anglican
Church. As a consequence his responsibility will include guidance in the process for
appointment of a minister, overseeing the daily running of the church, as well as offering
pulpit supply on Sundays. He may appoint someone on his behalf.<br />
<br />
Although the Anglican Church now has the role of overseeing the vacancy, it does not
confine the selection of a future appointee to come from that denomination. St Johns can
broaden its outlook to find the best considered candidate from any of the three partner
Churches and beyond.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please ask any member of the Leadership Team.<br />

Kindy Playground update: Over the Christmas period we will be re-covering the downstairs
playground black matting with an artificial grass. We are installing a drain along the edge of
the concrete pathway. We will be removing the fixed climbing equipment. We are
negotiating with Kindy about a plan to create a seating area and bark ground cover of 4.3
by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree. Lorraine

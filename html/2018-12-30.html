         Prayer Points for: 
    </strong> 
    Brenda Ryan and Mary Hall for good health. For the families of both
    Loas Toung and Joyce Leach as they mourn the loss of a loved one. For two people, one to
    be our Presbyterian representative and another to be our second Anglican representative.
    Prayer for both St Johns and Lorraine (and family) as we move into this time of change.

<strong>
    Thank you and New Year Blessings
</strong>
Thank you to all for your Christmas gifts and good wishes. Lorraine and family have been
well spoilt again this year with your gifts. As we enter the New Year may God’s blessings of
renewal touch your hearts, minds, and souls and fill you with deep abiding peace that gives
life in the middle of chaos, pain, hurts, love, laughter and joy. Have a great year. Lorraine

<strong>
        Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team met with the Church Partners on Tuesday night, the 11<sup>th</sup> Dec. Of the
eleven members, ten were able to attend and following briefings from the three Partner
Church Representatives a vote was held to determine our <strong>Coordinating Partner</strong> (to be
called Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on.<br >
The result was a substantial majority vote for the <strong>Anglican</strong> Church to take this role.
In due course Archdeacon Michael Berry will take up the management role for the Anglican
Church. As a consequence his responsibility will include guidance in the process for
appointment of a minister, overseeing the daily running of the church, as well as offering
pulpit supply on Sundays. He may appoint someone on his behalf.<br />
<br />
Although the Anglican Church now has the role of overseeing the vacancy, it does not
confine the selection of a future appointee to come from that denomination. St Johns can
broaden its outlook to find the best considered candidate from any of the three partner
Churches and beyond.<br />
<br />
If you have any questions please ask any member of the Leadership Team.<br />

<strong>
    Picnic Lunch January 6<sup>th</sup>
</strong>
at Music Point to join with our Mandarin brothers and sisters.
So no lunch at Church, but at a picnic at Music Point together :) following morning worship.

<strong>Kindergarten Playground update:</strong> Over the Christmas period we will be re-covering the downstairs
playground black matting with an artificial grass. We are installing a drain along the edge of
the concrete pathway. We will be removing the fixed climbing equipment. We are
negotiating with Kindy about a plan to create a seating area and bark ground cover of 4.3
by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree. Lorraine

<strong>
    Hall Kitchen Update
</strong>
We have a tiler coming in early January to install splashback tiles
around the stoves. This is the last of the renovations, leaving only the task of findingsuitable large plates to replace our light brown speckled ones. The Light brown plates are
too big for the bottom drawer of the dishwasher, so we are replacing them.

<hr />
<strong>The Francis-Dittmers are leaving</strong><br />
Lorraine’s last day with us will be Sunday the 3 rd of February. The combined service will be
followed by our farewell to Lorraine and family, and a shared lunch to follow. It is fourteen
and a half years since they joined us, we have enjoyed significant participation of the family
in our church life.<br />
In recognition of the service to St Johns, a presentation will be offered to Lorraine on the 3 rd
of February. If you would like to contribute towards a gift, please make a donation in a
plain envelope with Lorraine written on the outside, and place in the offering or deliver to
the church office.<br />
Thank you. Alan Vickers, Session Clerk<br />

The Three Wise Women<br />
You do know what would have happened if it had been three wise WOMEN instead of men,
don't you? They would have asked for directions, arrived on time, helped deliver the baby,
cleaned the stable, made a casserole, and brought disposable nappies as gifts!

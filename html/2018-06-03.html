    The boy Samuel ministered before the LORD under Eli. In those days the word of
        the LORD was rare; there were not many visions.
</p>
<p>
    
        <sup>2</sup>One night Eli, whose eyes were becoming so weak that he could barely see, was lying
        down in his usual place. <sup>3</sup>> The lamp of God had not yet gone out, and Samuel was lying
        down in the house of the LORD , where the ark of God was. <sup>4</sup>> Then the LORD called
        Samuel. Samuel answered, “Here I am.” <sup>5</sup>> And he ran to Eli and said, “Here I am; you
        called me.” But Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.” So he went and lay
        down. <sup>6</sup>> Again the LORD called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and went to Eli and said,
        “Here I am; you called me.” “My son,” Eli said, “I did not call; go back and lie down.”
</p>
<p>
        <sup>7</sup>Now Samuel did not yet know the LORD : The word of the LORD had not yet been
        revealed to him. <sup>8</sup>> A third time the LORD called, “Samuel!” And Samuel got up and
        went to Eli and said, “Here I am; you called me.” Then Eli realized that the LORD was
        calling the boy. <sup>9</sup>> So Eli told Samuel, “Go and lie down, and if he calls you, say,
        ‘Speak, LORD , for your servant is listening.’” So Samuel went and lay down in his place.
</p>
<p>

        <sup>10</sup>>The LORD came and stood there, calling as at the other times, “Samuel! Samuel!”
        Then Samuel said, “Speak, for your servant is listening.”

<strong>Day of Prayer to end famine - 10 June 2018</strong><br />
The hungry are of special concern to God for it is on their behalf God will ask us: “Did you
feed me when I was hungry?” (Matthew 25: 35-40)<br />

The World Council of Churches is running a global day of prayer to end famine on 10 June.
The idea behind this is to unite ecumenical partners and faith communities all over the
world as a prayerful and spiritual movement to encourage prayer, reflection and action.

The Anglican Church has arranged for two shipping containers 
to take building supplies and equipment to Tonga 
to help the Anglican churches to be better prepared to help 
rebuild after an event like Cyclone Gita. 
One container will be positioned at St Pauls Church in Nuku’alofa 
and the other at All Saints Church in Fasi. 
Both will be used to store prepositioned supplies and one of 
them will also be fitted out and used as a small joinery and 
carpentry workshop to help develop building skills of local communities.
<div><strong>If you have tools (such as hammers, screw drivers, crowbars) that 
    you no longer need, please can you contact Father Lui Tuilotolava on 027 286 4064 
    and he will arrange for them to be picked up and added to the shipment of supplies.</strong><hr />

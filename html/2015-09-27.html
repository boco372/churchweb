        Esther 4:9-17 (NIV)
        <br />
        <sup>9</sup> Hathak went back and reported to Esther what Mordecai had said. <sup>10</sup> Then she instructed him to say to Mordecai, <sup>11</sup> “All the king’s officials and the people of the royal provinces know that for any man or woman who approaches the king in the inner court without being summoned the king has but one law: that they be put to death unless the king extends the gold scepter to them and spares their lives. But thirty days have passed since I was called to go to the king.” <sup>12</sup> When Esther’s words were reported to Mordecai, <sup>13</sup> he sent back this answer: “Do not think that because you are in the king’s house you alone of all the Jews will escape. <sup>14</sup> For if you remain silent at this time, relief and deliverance for the Jews will arise from another place, but you and your father’s family will perish. And who knows but that you have come to your royal position for such a time as this?” <sup>15</sup> Then Esther sent this reply to Mordecai: <sup>16</sup> “Go, gather together all the Jews who are in Susa, and fast for me. Do not eat or drink for three days, night or day. I and my attendants will fast as you do. When this is done, I will go to the king, even though it is against the law. And if I perish, I perish.” <sup>17</sup> So Mordecai went away and carried out all of Esther’s instructions.

        THANKSGIVING OFFERING:- 
    </strong>
    Each year we set one special Sunday for Thanksgiving. I don’t know how this tradition at St Johns arose but I assume it reflects the old idea of Harvest Thanksgiving. In an urban parish we can give thanks for the arrival of Spring after a wet, cold Winter and personally, thanks for any special blessing we have received during the past year.
</p>
<p>
    The Leadership Team have decided that 90% of this year’s Thanksgiving will be added to the fund we have set up to meet the cost of our latest staff member, the Children, Youth and Family leader. The 10% remaining, as usual, will be given outside the parish, this year to the Tear Fund Appeal for victims of slavery and human trafficking.
</p>
<p>
    Giving to the Thanksgiving offering can be through marked envelopes which regular envelope givers will have received with their bundle of envelopes. I have additional envelopes available which you should mark with your number so that the amount can be added to your Inland Revenue receipt at the end of March 2016.
</p>
<p>
    Any questions, please talk to me or one of the Finance Team (Christo John, Shania Qui and Brannie Ma) Thank you Bob Williamson

        Open Home Foundation
    </strong>
    is a Christian social work agency which has been running for over 30 years. We provide foster care for in the Auckland community for two main groups of children and young people. One group are kids in state care through Child Youth and Family; the other are kids who have an intellectual disability whose families need respite care. What makes OHF distinct is that all of our staff and foster carers are Christians. We believe that one of the most practical ways of showing the love of Christ is by Christians opening their homes to children and teenagers in need. We would love the opportunity to let people in your congregation know about our agency to see if any of them could be open to becoming foster carers for us.

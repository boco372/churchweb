        Jesus Changes Water Into Wine
    </strong>
    <br />
    2 On the third day a wedding took place at Cana in Galilee. Jesus’ mother was
there, <sup>2</sup>and Jesus and his disciples had also been invited to the wedding. <sup>3</sup> When
the wine was gone, Jesus’ mother said to him, “They have no more wine.”
<sup>4</sup>“Woman, why do you involve me?” Jesus replied. “My hour has not yet come.”
<sup>5</sup>His mother said to the servants, “Do whatever he tells you.”
<br />
<sup>6</sup>Nearby stood six stone water jars, the kind used by the Jews for ceremonial
washing, each holding from twenty to thirty gallons. <sup>7</sup> Jesus said to the
servants, “Fill the jars with water”; so they filled them to the brim. <sup>8</sup> Then he told
them, “Now draw some out and take it to the master of the banquet.”
<br />
They did so, <sup>9</sup> and the master of the banquet tasted the water that had been
turned into wine. He did not realize where it had come from, though the servants
who had drawn the water knew. Then he called the bridegroom aside <sup>10</sup> and said,
“Everyone brings out the choice wine first and then the cheaper wine after the
guests have had too much to drink; but you have saved the best till now.”
<br />
<sup>11</sup>What Jesus did here in Cana of Galilee was the first of the signs through which he
revealed his glory; and his disciples believed in him.

<strong>
    Ministerial Vacancy, the First Step.
</strong>
The Leadership Team has determined that our <strong>Coordinating Partner</strong> (to be called
Appointing Partner after July 2019) from now on is the Anglican Church.<br >

Archdeacon Michael Berry has informed us that Archdeacon Carole Hughes is going to
manage this process as all the current vacancies in this diocese are in Michael’s region and
he needs to share the workload. They are working on identifying a priest for the interim
and will inform us as soon as they can. It is standard Anglican practice to do nothing in a
parish until the incumbent has actually left.<br />

    Kindergarten playground update
</strong>
Please go and have a look at the children’s playground downstairs. We have had the black
matting re-covered with artificial grass. We have had a drain installed along the edge of the
concrete pathway. The fixed climbing equipment has been removed and a seating area has
been created with bark ground cover of 4.3 by 4.4m around the base of Beryl’s Tree.

        We have had a tiler install splashback tiles around the
stoves. Thank you Felicity for the donation of the tiles. All
that is left of our kitchen renovations is the task of finding
suitable large plates to replace our light brown speckled
ones. The light brown plates are too big for the bottom
draw<strong>er</strong> of the dishwasher, so we are replacing them.

    THANK YOU 
</strong>
“Thank you to all those who contributed photos to the St Johns Photo Archive.” A third volume has been started with photos from our 40th celebration and includes additional photos taken by John Copping. All three volumes have been available in the church foyer during the past week, and will now be kept in the church office. If anyone wishes to view them at church, or borrow them for a short time, ask Lorraine or Jeannine.
<p>
    There are more photos to be processed, but these can wait until 2016! The demands of the Christmas Season come first!
</p>
<p>
    Best wishes to you all! Trevor Haigh.

        FAMILY BARBECUE:- 
    </strong>
    The Leadership Team has decided to hold a "Family Barbecue" before Christmas. The "Family" we have in mind is the community who use our buildings through the year - Kindergarten, Mainly Music, Holiday Programme, our Korean friends etc. etc. and all their families. We want to make a time to meet them, get to know them, thank them for the rent they pay us and in an informal setting be the Gospel. No preaching - just invite them to our Christmas services.
</p>
<p>
    
</p>
<p>
    To make this work it is vital that you, the congregations of St Johns, are there to be the hosts. Bring your own family.
</p>
<p>
    The date and time is the afternoon of the first Sunday in December, Sunday the 6th of December at 4pm. Put it in your diary and pray for a fine day.
</p>

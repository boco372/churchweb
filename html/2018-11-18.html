<div class="boxed">
    As Jesus was leaving the temple, one of his disciples said to him, “Look, Teacher! What massive stones! What magnificent buildings!” 
    <sup>2</sup> “Do you see all these great buildings?” replied Jesus. “Not one stone here will be left on another; every one will be thrown down.” <sup>3</sup> As Jesus was sitting on the Mount of Olives opposite the temple, Peter, James, John and Andrew asked him privately, 
    <sup>4</sup> “Tell us, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign that they are all about to be fulfilled?” 
    <sup>5</sup> Jesus said to them: “Watch out that no one deceives you. 
    <sup>6</sup> Many will come in my name, claiming, ‘I am he,’ and will deceive many. 
    <sup>7</sup> When you hear of wars and rumors of wars, do not be alarmed. Such things must happen, but the end is still to come. 
    <sup>8</sup> Nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be earthquakes in various places, and famines. These are the beginning of birth pains.

    <b>
        From Lorraine:
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    I have informed the Leadership Team (Tuesday 6th November) and both our English and Mandarin Congregations on Sunday 11th November of my resignation from ministry settlement at St Johns Bucklands Beach Cooperating Church. My last Sunday and farewell will be 3rd February 2019.
</p>
<p>
    Sudden change and having to transition is always a bit of a shock to us all, but once we start the process of moving forward it does get easier. At this time of our church life, the Leadership Team will be the ones who work to maintain our church life and how we look to the future and search for a new minister.
</p>
<p>
    Our Church partners will also be very involved with us. As the Methodist church is our current coordinating partner, the Rev Marilyn Welch as our Methodist Superintendent, will start us on this journey. She will soon call a meeting of the Leadership Team and Church partner representatives and start the talking. One of the first things we will have to do as a congregation is decide which denomination (Anglican, Presbyterian or Methodist) we will have as the partner church from which we will call our next minister. Anticipating the new changes of our UCANZ Procedures, this partner church will be called our ‘Appointing Partner’.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions – and want to talk about all this please contact Lorraine.

    American Gospel – Christ Alone Saturday 17 November 7pm- 10 pm

<p>
    The first in a 2-part series about the state of Christianity in America and the prosperity gospel has taken root. It will examine what are the key themes of this false gospel, and present a more beautiful and accurate version of Christianity as described in Scripture and how we should think about it. Here’s a trailer if you would like a taster: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jU75EzbdNEc

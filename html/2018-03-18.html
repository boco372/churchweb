    <p>
      <sup>31</sup>Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will make a new covenant with
         the house of Israel, and with the house of Judah:<br >
      <sup>32</sup>Not according to the covenant that I made with their fathers in the day that I
         took them by the hand to bring them out of the land of Egypt; which my
         covenant they brake, although I was an husband unto them, saith the LORD:<br />
      <sup>33</sup>But this shall be the covenant that I will make with the house of Israel; after
         those days, saith the LORD, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in
         their hearts; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.<br />
      <sup>34</sup>And they shall teach no more every man his neighbour, and every man his
        brother, saying, Know the LORD: for they shall all know me, from the least of
        them unto the greatest of them, saith the LORD: for I will forgive their iniquity,
        and I will remember their sin no more.<br />

    <strong>LENT BIBLE STUDY: You are invited to stay after morning worship on Palm Sunday,
    25 th March and join in a Bible Study. We will conclude by sharing a light lunch
    together.</strong> We will be following the Lectio Divina method of group study. Our passage
    will be Mark 14:32-42.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lectio Divinia study method below is what we have followed at St Johns previously with
      Chris Skinner:<br >
      <em>
        Choose a significant Gospel passage<br >
        Read passage through out loud (by a good reader)<br >
        After a short time participants speak aloud a key phrase or word that particularly struck
        them. There is no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
        The passage is read again slowly and meaningfully
        In groups of four to six, participants share on the passage and their significant word or
        phrase. Again no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
        Return to larger group. Some may wish to share in the larger group. Provide some time for
        this.

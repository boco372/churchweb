			<sup>7</sup> But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.”
		</p>
		<p>
			<sup>8</sup> Then Jesse called Abinadab and had him pass in front of Samuel. But Samuel said, “The LORD has not chosen this one either.” <sup>9</sup> Jesse then had Shammah pass by, but Samuel said, “Nor has the LORD chosen this one.”<sup>10</sup> Jesse had seven of his sons pass before Samuel, but Samuel said to him, “The LORD has not chosen these.” <sup>11</sup> So he asked Jesse, “Are these all the sons you have?” “There is still the youngest,” Jesse answered. “He is tending the sheep.”
		</p>
		<p>
			Samuel said, “Send for him; we will not sit down until he arrives.” <sup>12</sup> So he sent for him and had him brought in. He was glowing with health and had a fine appearance and handsome features. Then the LORD said, “Rise and anoint him; this is the one.” <sup>13</sup> So Samuel took the horn of oil and anointed him in the presence of his brothers, and from that day on the Spirit of the LORD came powerfully upon David. Samuel then went to Ramah.

		Real Life with John Cowan 7.30pm Sunday nights on Newstalk ZB John Cowan’s guest this Sunday night 17 June is William Paul Young. William is a Canadian best-selling author of the novels The Shack, Cross Roads and Eve. Born in Alberta, Canada, but lived with his missionary parents in the highlands of Papua New Guinea among the Dani, a technologically stone age tribal people until he was six years old. These became his family as the first white child and outsider who ever spoke their language, he was granted unusual access into their culture and community. William’s novel The Shack resulted from a manuscript for his children and close friends on his perspectives on God and on the inner healing he had experienced as an adult. His latest project is the recently released movie, Heart of Man, a narrative storytelling and documentary film that reveals the compassionate heart of God that illuminates an age-old Truth: that shame is not a barrier to God’s love. If you are interested in seeing The Heart of Man movie it premieres on Tuesday 26 June, 6.30 pm at Event Cinemas St Lukes.

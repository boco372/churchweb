<div class="column one-half"><br />Exodus 1:8-22 <sup>8</sup>Than a new king, to whom Joseph meant nothing, came to power in Egypt. <sup>9</sup> “Look,” he said to his people, “the Israelites have become far too numerous for us. <sup>10</sup> Come, we must deal shrewdly with them or they will become even more numerous and, if war breaks out, will join our enemies, fight against us and leave the country.” <sup>11</sup> So they put slave masters over them to oppress them with forced labour, and they built Pithom and Rameses as store cities for Pharaoh. <sup>12</sup> But the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and spread; so the Egyptians came to dread the Israelites <sup>13</sup> and worked them ruthlessly. <sup>14</sup> They made their lives bitter with harsh labour in brick and mortar and with all kinds of work in the fields; in all their harsh labour the Egyptians worked them ruthlessly. <sup>15</sup>The king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, whose names were Shiphrah and Puah, <sup>16</sup>”When you are helping the Hebrew women during childbirth on the delivery stool, if you see that the baby is a boy, kill him; but if it is a girl, let her live.” <sup>17</sup>The midwives, however, feared God and did not do what the king of Egypt had told them to do; they let the boys live. <sup>18</sup> Then the king of Egypt summoned the midwives and asked them, “Why have you done this? Why have you let the boys live?” <sup>19</sup> The midwives answered Pharaoh, “Hebrew women are not like Egyptian women; they are vigorous and give birth before the midwives arrive.” <sup>20</sup> So God was kind to the midwives and the people increased and became even more numerous. <sup>21</sup>And because the midwives feared God, he gave them families of their own. <sup>22</sup> The Pharaoh gave this order to all his people: “Every Hebrew boy that is born you must throw into the Nile, but let every girl live.”</div>

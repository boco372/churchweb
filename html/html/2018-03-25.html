      <sup>11</sup> As they approached Jerusalem and came to Bethphage and Bethanyat the
      Mount of Olives, Jesus sent two of his disciples, <sup>2</sup> saying to them, “Go to the
      village ahead of you, and just as you enter it, you will find a colt tied there,
      which no one has ever ridden. Untie it and bring it here. <sup>3</sup> If anyone asks you,
      ‘Why are you doing this?’ say, ‘The Lord needs it and will send it back here
      shortly.’” <sup>4</sup> They went and found a colt outside in the street, tied at a
      doorway. As they untied it, <sup>5</sup> some people standing there asked, “What are you
      doing, untying that colt?” <sup>6</sup> They answered as Jesus had told them to, and the
      people let them go. <sup>7</sup> When they brought the colt to Jesus and threw their
      cloaks over it, he sat on it. <sup>8</sup> Many people spread their cloaks on the road, while
      others spread branches they had cut in the fields. <sup>9</sup> Those who went ahead and
      those who followed shouted, “Hosanna! Blessed is he who comes in the
      name of the Lord! <sup>10</sup> “Blessed is the coming kingdom of our father David!
      Hosanna in the highest heaven!”<br />
      <sup>11</sup>Jesus entered Jerusalem and went into the temple courts. He looked
      around at everything, but since it was already late, he went out to
      Bethany with the Twelve.<br />

    <strong>LENT BIBLE STUDY: You are invited to stay after morning worship on this Sunday, Palm Sunday,
    25<sup>th</sup> March and join in a Bible Study. We will conclude by sharing a light lunch
    together.</strong> We will be following the Lectio Divina method of group study. Our passage
    will be Mark 14:32-42.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lectio Divinia study method below is what we have followed at St Johns previously with
      Chris Skinner:<br >
      <em>
        Choose a significant Gospel passage<br >
        Read passage through out loud<br >
        After a short time participants speak aloud a key phrase or word that particularly struck
        them. There is no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
        The passage is read again slowly and meaningfully
        In groups of four to six, participants share on the passage and their significant word or
        phrase. Again no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
        Return to larger group. Some may wish to share in the larger group. Provide some time for
        this.
      </em>

    through Jane at the office. Ph 5354403 or <href mailto: admin@howpres.org.nz.> admin@howpres.org.nz</href>

<strong>re.cognition: Stations of the Resurrection.</strong><br >
<div style='float:left; width:10%'>

</div>
<div style='float:left; width:80%'>
<p>
        re.cognition is a station-based interactive art installation at Holy Trinity
        Cathedral in Auckland curated by Mark Pierson (Rhythms of Grace congregation
        at The Upper Room) and Sarah Park (Anglican Diocese of Auckland). It will run
        from Tuesday 3 – Sunday 8 April, from 6–9pm. Entry by Koha.   
</p>
<p>
    re.cognition invites visitors to engage with the biblical narrative of Easter, by
    moving through fifteen stations which encompass crucifixion, resurrection and
    ascension. Each station will employ different art media to present the story in a
    multi-sensory way. Visitors will be invited to engage with the installations, and
    reflect on what the Easter story might mean for them.
</p>
<p>
        We envisage it will take visitors 60-90 minutes to make their way through the
        installation, over which time they will move over the entire Cathedral site.
        Please note: many of the stations that comprise re.cognition are positioned in
        low lighting, uneven ground or are accessed via stairs. 11 out of 15 stations are
        accessible to all, however we regret that 4 stations are not accessible to all.   
</p>
<p>
        Holy Trinity Cathedral is located on the corner of Parnell Road and St Stephen’s
        Avenue, Parnell. There is a pay and display car park which is accessible via
        Brighton Road or Parnell Road. Search for re.cognition on Facebook.

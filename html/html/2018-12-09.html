<strong>From Lorraine, about looking for the next minister and church they belong to.</strong> I have
had a lot of questions about what the next step is for St Johns, to make the situation clear:
the Leadership Team will be meeting with the Church Partner representatives on
Wednesday 11<sup>th</sup> December 7:30 pm to hear presentations of how the Anglican,
Presbyterian and Methodist Churches fill clergy vacancy in parishes and search for a new
minister. As the exiting minister I will not be present at this meeting.
</p>
<p>
The Partners' Church Team will be Dr Rod Watts Executive Officer for Northern Presbytery;
Archdeacon Sarah Moss from the Anglican Church; Mrs Jackie McGeorge, Area
Superintendent for Manukau Synod of Methodist Church and Ms Dilys Davies, (Methodist)
Auckland Regional Forum. Dilys will chair this part of the meeting.
</p>
<p>
As this is an important decision, influencing the life of the congregation for potentially
many years into the future, I had presumed the Leadership Team would then be bringing a
recommendation to the congregation for a congregational decision about which church, St
Johns would have as its new Coordinating Partner (which would become the Appointing
Partner when the changes take effect in 2019) because the new minister would belong to
the coordinating / appointing Church.
</p>
<p>
However, following the Leadership Team on Tuesday 4<sup>th</sup> December I need to inform the
congregation that the Leadership Team does not have to consult the congregation through
a congregational meeting and that the decision <strong>will be made</strong> at the meeting on December
11<sup>th</sup> by the Church Partners which includes the Leadership Team.
</p>
<p>
<strong>The Procedures</strong> (Cooperating Church’s rules): 2.1.9 “When a ministerial vacancy occurs the
Coordinating Partner (currently the Methodist Church for us) will meet with the other
Participating Partner(s) and the local church council to decide which partner will act as
Coordinating Partner. The Coordinating Partner takes a lead in helping the local church to
develop both local church and minister profiles.”
</p>
<p>
If you have some thoughts about which Church for the next minister to belong to; whom
you believe should be our next co-ordinating partner please speak to Leadership Team
members.

          James 1:17-27;<br />
      </strong>
          17 Every good and perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of the
heavenly lights, who does not change like shifting shadows. <sup>18</sup> He chose to give us birth
through the word of truth, that we might be a kind of first-fruits of all he created.
Listening and Doing<br />
19 My dear brothers and sisters, take note of this: Everyone should be quick to listen, slow
to speak and slow to become angry, <sup>20</sup> because human anger does not produce the
righteousness that God desires. <sup>21</sup> Therefore, get rid of all moral filth and the evil that is
so prevalent and humbly accept the word planted in you, which can save you. <sup>22</sup> Do not
merely listen to the word, and so deceive yourselves. Do what it says. <sup>23</sup> Anyone who
listens to the word but does not do what it says is like someone who looks at his face in a
mirror <sup>24</sup> and, after looking at himself, goes away and immediately forgets what he looks
like. <sup>25</sup> But whoever looks intently into the perfect law that gives freedom, and continues
in it—not forgetting what they have heard, but doing it—they will be blessed in what they
do. <sup>26</sup> Those who consider themselves religious and yet do not keep a tight rein on their
tongues deceive themselves, and their religion is worthless. <sup>27</sup> Religion that God our
Father accepts as pure and faultless is this: to look after orphans and widows in their
distress and to keep oneself from being polluted by the world.

        Newsletter Information Note for the Parish from the Leadership Team<br />
  </strong>
  I want to bring several matters from the Leadership Team to your attention for the
   Annual General Meeting and ask for your prayerful consideration.<br />
  1. The Leadership and Finance Teams are supporting an addition to our administrative staff
in this year’s budget. We have budgeted for 5 hours a week paid Mandarin ministry support.
It is an extension of the administrative support given to the congregation by Alison Stanton.
While most of Alison’s work supports St Johns Parish as a whole, she does work to
specifically support the English speaking fellowship. We believe by extending the
administrative support specifically for our Mandarin Fellowship we are seeking to redress
this imbalance. We will be presenting a motion to the AGM asking for congregational
support for this.<br />
2. We will be bringing an update of the Leadership Team’s working on the 5 year strategic
plan.<br />
3. We will be bringing a motion that we change what has been a choice made year by year
of a Charity recipient for our Thanksgiving and Christmas Special donations to being fixed to
our chosen charity for 5 years. We are asking for suggestions / nominations for that Charity
from you, and that these be given to the Leadership Team for the November 6th 2018
meeting.<br />
Blessings Lorraine

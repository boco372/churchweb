      <p>Jesus visits his hometown, Nazareth.
        As a skilled carpenter Jesus was most likely not a member of the impoverished labouring classes,
        his status was still lower than that of the educated classes.
        Therefore his behaviours such as preaching in the synagogue could have been viewed as an
        attempt to elevate his own position above his fellow villagers.
        They are amazed and offended at Jesus and He is amazed at
        their unbelief and leaves in search of more welcoming areas.

      <strong>Mark 6: 1-13 (NIV) A Prophet without Honour</strong>
    </span>
    <br />
    Jesus left there and went to his hometown, accompanied by his disciples.
    When the Sabbath came, he began to teach in the synagogue, and many who heard him were amazed.
    “Where did this man get these things?” they asked.
    “What’s this wisdom that has been given him? What are these remarkable miracles he is performing?
    Isn’t this the carpenter? Isn’t this Mary’s son and the brother of James, Joseph, Judas and Simon?
    Aren’t his sisters here with us?”
    And they took offence at him.
    Jesus said to them, “A prophet is not without honour except in his own town, among his relatives and in his own home.”
    5 He could not do any miracles there, except lay his hands on a few sick people and heal them.
    He was amazed at their lack of faith.

    <strong>53</strong> Who has believed our message and to whom has the arm of the
    LORD been revealed? <sup>2</sup> He grew up before him like a tender shoot, and
    like a root out of dry ground. He had no beauty or majesty to attract
    us to him, nothing in his appearance that we should desire him. <sup>3</sup> He
    was despised and rejected by mankind, a man of suffering, and familiar
    with pain. Like one from whom people hide their faces he was
    despised, and we held him in low esteem. <sup>4</sup> Surely he took up our pain
    and bore our suffering, yet we considered him punished by God,
    stricken by him, and afflicted. <sup>5</sup> But he was pierced for our
    transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities; the punishment that
    brought us peace was on him, and by his wounds we are healed. <sup>6</sup> We
    all, like sheep, have gone astray, each of us has turned to our own way;
    and the LORD has laid on him the iniquity of us all. <sup>7</sup> He was oppressed
    and afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth; he was led like a lamb to
    the slaughter, and as a sheep before its shearers is silent, so he did not
    open his mouth.

  <strong>
    BARNABAS FUND ART EXHIBITION 8 November 5 -7 pm.
  </strong>
  This art exhibition is to raise money to free a family from slavery.<br />
  The purpose it to raise money to free a family from slavery in Pakistan. Many
Christians in Pakistan are trapped in “bonded labour” and it not only affects them,
but their children and can even extend into future generations. The art exhibit will
feature paintings for sale the size of the bricks made in the kilns in Pakistan as well as
other vibrant artwork from several NZ artists. All painting are done by local
artists. The paragraph below explains why we are doing this.<br />
Brick-kiln workers in Pakistan, many of whom are impoverished Christians, are low
paid. If someone falls sick or another kind of family crisis occurs, they have to take a
loan from their employer, the Muslim owner of the brick-kiln. After this, money is
deducted from their weekly wages to pay the interest on the loan, and this can go on
for years, even for generations. As long as the debt remains, the family is “bonded” to
their brick-kiln. They cannot leave to get another job and have to try to subsist on the
reduced wages: it is almost like slavery. They may have no hope of regaining their
freedom, and their children can’t go to school. We hope to raise enough money,
about $4,000, to free two families from debt. It will make a huge difference to their
lives and their children’s futures.<br />
Also, Patrick Sookhdeo will be in the Auckland area on 4 th November and will be
speaking at 10:00am Sunnynook Baptist Church and also 6:30pm at Mangere Bridge
Baptist Church.<br />

        <p>
          <sup>2</sup>&nbsp;After six days Jesus took Peter, James and John with him and led them up a high mountain, where they were all alone.
                       There he was transfigured before them.
          <sup>3</sup>&nbsp;His clothes became dazzling white, whiter than anyone in the world could bleach them.
          <sup>4</sup>&nbsp;And there appeared before them Elijah and Moses, who were talking with Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>5</sup>&nbsp;Peter said to Jesus, “Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.
                       Let us put up three shelters—one for you, one for Moses and one for Elijah.”
          <sup>6</sup>&nbsp;(He did not know what to say, they were so frightened.)
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>7</sup>&nbsp;Then a cloud appeared and covered them, and a voice came from the cloud: “This is my Son, whom I love. Listen to him!”
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>8</sup>&nbsp;Suddenly, when they looked around, they no longer saw anyone with them except Jesus.
        </p>
        <p>
          <sup>9</sup>&nbsp;As they were coming down the mountain, Jesus gave them orders not to tell anyone what they had seen until the Son of Man had risen from the dead.

  <p><strong>English for Kiwi Life</strong><br />
    – Sadly there was insufficient interest in the ‘English as a Second
    Language’ course which was due to start during the week and the organisers cancelled.
    The same course was run at St Johns during the second half of 2017. A group of adult
    students from Russia, China, Korea... who live in the local community participated, some
    enquiring about St Johns and its services, others interested in what other activities we hold
    such as Mainly Music. The course was a wonderful outreach into the community and also
    helped St Johns financially. Please pray for more students to come to an enrolment
    morning here on Tuesday 13 February 9.30 am to 10.30 am.

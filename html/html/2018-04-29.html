        <strong>The Vine and the Branches</strong><br />
        <p>
                15 “I am the true vine, and my Father is the gardener. <sup>2</sup> He cuts off every branch
                in me that bears no fruit, while every branch that does bear fruit he prunes [a] so
                that it will be even more fruitful. <sup>3</sup> You are already clean because of the word I
                have spoken to you. <sup>4</sup> Remain in me, as I also remain in you. No branch can bear
                fruit by itself; it must remain in the vine. Neither can you bear fruit unless you
                remain in me.
          </p>
          <p>
              <sup>5</sup> “I am the vine; you are the branches. If you remain in me and I in you, you will
              bear much fruit; apart from me you can do nothing. <sup>6</sup> If you do not remain in
              me, you are like a branch that is thrown away and withers; such branches are
              picked up, thrown into the fire and burned. <sup>7</sup> If you remain in me and my words
              remain in you, ask whatever you wish, and it will be done for you. <sup>8</sup> This is to my
              Father’s glory, that you bear much fruit, showing yourselves to be my disciples.

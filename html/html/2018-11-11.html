    <sup>38</sup>And he said unto them in his doctrine, Beware of the scribes, which love to go
in long clothing, and love salutations in the marketplaces,<br />
<sup>39</sup>And the chief seats in the synagogues, and the uppermost rooms at feasts:<br />
<sup>40</sup>Which devour widows' houses, and for a pretence make long prayers: these
shall receive greater damnation.<br />
<sup>41</sup>And Jesus sat over against the treasury, and beheld how the people cast
money into the treasury: and many that were rich cast in much.<br />
<sup>42</sup>And there came a certain poor widow, and she threw in two mites, which make
a farthing.<br />
<sup>43</sup>And he called unto him his disciples, and saith unto them, Verily I say unto you,
that this poor widow hath cast more in, than all they which have cast into the
treasury:<br />
<sup>44</sup>For all they did cast in of their abundance; but she of her want did cast in
all that she had, even all her living.

        Kindergarten – Little Cubs     
    </strong>
    Many children recently have turned five and started school. This
    means the kindergarten has spaces and needs more enrolments. Please pray for more
    children.

  <strong>
      Feedback please:
    </strong> The Leadership Team is considering the issue of ground cover for the
  ‘garden’ the Kindergarten play area, currently covered by black matting, around ‘Beryl’s
  Tree.<br />
  We have several factors at play: 1. Beryl’s Tree continues to grow and the roots have lifted
  the matting to a stage where it is becoming a safety issue for anyone playing on it. The
  Ministry of Education (Early Childhood) have said the matting must be repaired / replaced.<br />
  2. There is a drain running directly under the playground / tree which already we have had
  to cut root damage from. 3. With the heavy rain / downpours we have been experiencing
  the drainage flow is not as fast as is needed and water is very close to flowing into the
  ground floor rooms, of course once the rain stops it clears within minutes.<br />
  So the Leadership Team will need to make some decisions all of which will cost, but we
  have included this in our current budget. Our options are many but the following are our
  attempts to balance our needs and listen to the Kindergarten’s concerns.<br />
  A) We can install a new drain along the concrete / matting edge, and then repair the
  matting or replace the matting with Tiger Turf like grass.<br />
  B) We can install the new drain, replace matting and re-contour the land shape / water flow.<br />
  C) We can cut down Beryl’s tree, re-contour the area, install a shade cloth and depending
  on finances repair matting or install new surface coverings.<br />
  We are not asking you to make the decision – but we do want to receive feedback on your
  thoughts, especially with option (C) – and the removal of Beryl’s Tree. Please talk to
  Lorraine, Alan or Bob. Thank you.<br />

        Movie @ St Johns
</strong>
<br />
Joshua Wong is inviting us all to come and watch a new movie here at St Johns, “American
Gospel – Christ Alone”. Watch this space for a confirmed day and time.<br />
This new movie’s main premise is to expose the insidious nature of the prosperity gospel
that has gained popularity in Western cultures (particularly America). It intends to counter
this movement by presenting a more accurate and proper picture of what the true gospel is
meant to be. Here’s a trailer if you would like a taster:

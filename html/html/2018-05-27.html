<p><strong>Isaiah’s Commission </strong></p>
<p><strong>6</strong> In the year that King Uzziah died, I saw the Lord, high and exalted, seated on a throne; and the train of his robe filled the temple. <sup>2</sup> Above him were seraphim, each with six wings: With two wings they covered their faces, with two they covered their feet, and with two they were flying. <sup>3</sup> And they were calling to one another: “Holy, holy, holy is the LORD Almighty; the whole earth is full of his glory.” <sup>4</sup> At the sound of their voices the doorposts and thresholds shook and the temple was filled with smoke. <sup>5</sup> “Woe to me!” I cried. “I am ruined! For I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among a people of unclean lips, and my eyes have seen the King, the LORD Almighty.” <sup>6</sup> Then one of the seraphim flew to me with a live coal in his hand, which he had taken with tongs from the altar. <sup>7</sup>With it he touched my mouth and said, “See, this has touched your lips; your guilt is taken away and your sin atoned for.” <sup>8</sup>Then I heard the voice of the Lord saying, “Whom shall I send? And who will go for us?” </p>

The Anglican Church has arranged for two shipping containers to take building supplies and equipment to Tonga to help the Anglican churches to be better prepared to help rebuild after an event like Cyclone Gita. One container will be positioned at St Pauls Church in Nuku’alofa and the other at All Saints Church in Fasi. Both will be used to store prepositioned supplies and one of them will also be fitted out and used as a small joinery and carpentry workshop to help develop building skills of local communities.
<div><strong>If you have tools (such as hammers, screw drivers, crowbars) that you no longer need, please can you contact Father Lui Tuilotolava on 027 286 4064 and he will arrange for them to be picked up and added to the shipment of supplies.</strong><hr />

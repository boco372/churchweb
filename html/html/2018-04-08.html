        John:19-23 John Jesus Appears to His Disciples<br />
        <sup>19</sup>On the evening of that first day of the week, when the disciples were
together, with the doors locked for fear of the Jewish leaders, Jesus came and
stood among them and said, “Peace be with you!” <sup>20</sup> After he said this, he
showed them his hands and side. The disciples were overjoyed when they saw
the Lord.<br />
<sup>21</sup>Again Jesus said, “Peace be with you! As the Father has sent me, I am sending
you.” <sup>22</sup> And with that he breathed on them and said, “Receive the Holy
Spirit. <sup>23</sup> If you forgive anyone’s sins, their sins are forgiven; if you do not forgive
them, they are not forgiven.”<br />

        English Language Classes
    </strong> 
    run by English Language Partners are free for NZ citizens.
    Currently (Term 1) they have stopped for Term 1. They need a minimum of 12
    students to get full government sponsorship. They currently only have 7, hence the
    prayer call for more students. The teacher is fully trained and really good. These
    classes are friendly, very practical and focus on helping students integrate into NZ
    society. We (St John’s) gain a little financially as they pay a rental for the hours on site,
    but by far the greatest gain is to have the friendly chatter, lots of people learning to
    know St Johns and people coming to church.

        Gallipoli to the Somme
     </strong>
      Holy Trinity Cathedral Saturday 14 April, 7.30pm Auckland
    Choral presents NZ composer Anthony Ritchie's moving work 'Gallipoli to the
    Somme'. Jenny Wollerman (soprano), Jarvis Dams (baritone). Pipers Sinfonia
    conducted by Uwe Grodd. Holy Trinity's resident organist Philip Smith will also play
    two solo works by Leonce de Saint-Martin and Jeanne Demessieux.<br />
    Anthony Ritchie's secular cantata Gallipoli to the Somme had a rapturous world
    premiere last October in Dunedin, and has so far been broadcast twice on RNZ.
    Against the backdrop of a horrific war, Ritchie celebrates the experiences of ordinary
    people from their songs, diary entries, letters, and poems, all brought into irresistible
    musical life. The Otago Daily Times reviewer was ecstatic. "After the final chord" she
    said "complete silence held the audience before prolonged applause and a standing
    ovation rewarded this brilliant new work". Tickets $56, concession available |

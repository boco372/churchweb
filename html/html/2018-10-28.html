    <strong>42</strong> Then Job replied to the LORD :<br />
    <sup>2</sup>“I know that you can do all things; <br />
    no purpose of yours can be thwarted.<br />
    <sup>3</sup>You asked, ‘Who is this that obscures my plans without knowledge?’<br />
    Surely I spoke of things I did not understand,<br />
    things too wonderful for me to know.<br />
    <br />
    <sup>4</sup>You said, ‘Listen now, and I will speak;<br />
    I will question you,<br />
    and you shall answer me.’<br />
    <sup>5</sup> My ears had heard of you<br />
    but now my eyes have seen you.<br />
    <sup>6</sup> Therefore I despise myself<br />
    and repent in dust and ashes.”<br />

    BARNABAS FUND ART EXHIBITION 8 November 5 -7 pm.
  </strong>
  This art exhibition is to raise money to free a family from slavery.<br />
  The purpose it to raise money to free a family from slavery in Pakistan. Many
Christians in Pakistan are trapped in “bonded labour” and it not only affects them,
but their children and can even extend into future generations. The art exhibit will
feature paintings for sale the size of the bricks made in the kilns in Pakistan as well as
other vibrant artwork from several NZ artists. All painting are done by local
artists. The paragraph below explains why we are doing this.<br />
Brick-kiln workers in Pakistan, many of whom are impoverished Christians, are low
paid. If someone falls sick or another kind of family crisis occurs, they have to take a
loan from their employer, the Muslim owner of the brick-kiln. After this, money is
deducted from their weekly wages to pay the interest on the loan, and this can go on
for years, even for generations. As long as the debt remains, the family is “bonded” to
their brick-kiln. They cannot leave to get another job and have to try to subsist on the
reduced wages: it is almost like slavery. They may have no hope of regaining their
freedom, and their children can’t go to school. We hope to raise enough money,
about $4,000, to free two families from debt. It will make a huge difference to their
lives and their children’s futures.<br />
Also, Patrick Sookhdeo will be in the Auckland area on 4 th November and will be
speaking at 10:00am Sunnynook Baptist Church and also 6:30pm at Mangere Bridge
Baptist Church.<br />

         Prayer Points for: 
    </strong> 
        Brenda Ryan and Mary Hall for good health. For two people, one to be our Presbyterian representative and another to be our second Anglican representative. Prayer for both St Johns and Lorraine (and family) as we move into this time of change.

    <b>
        From Lorraine:
    </b>
</p>
<p>
    I have informed the Leadership Team (Tuesday 6th November) and both our English and Mandarin Congregations on Sunday 11th November of my resignation from ministry settlement at St Johns Bucklands Beach Cooperating Church. My last Sunday and farewell will be 3rd February 2019.
</p>
<p>
    Sudden change and having to transition is always a bit of a shock to us all, but once we start the process of moving forward it does get easier. At this time of our church life, the Leadership Team will be the ones who work to maintain our church life and how we look to the future and search for a new minister.
</p>
<p>
    Our Church partners will also be very involved with us. As the Methodist church is our current coordinating partner, the Rev Marilyn Welch as our Methodist Superintendent, will start us on this journey. She will soon call a meeting of the Leadership Team and Church partner representatives and start the talking. One of the first things we will have to do as a congregation is decide which denomination (Anglican, Presbyterian or Methodist) we will have as the partner church from which we will call our next minister. Anticipating the new changes of our UCANZ Procedures, this partner church will be called our ‘Appointing Partner’.
</p>
<p>
    If you have any questions – and want to talk about all this please contact Lorraine.

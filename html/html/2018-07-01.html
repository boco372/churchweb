                <sup>1</sup>Out of the depths I cry to you, LORD ;<br />
                <sup>2</sup>Lord, hear my voice.<br />
                Let your ears be attentive<br />
                to my cry for mercy.<br />
                <sup>3</sup>If you, LORD , kept a record of sins,<br />
                Lord, who could stand?<br />
                <sup>4</sup>
                But with you there is forgiveness,<br />
                so that we can, with reverence, serve you.<br />
                <sup>5</sup>I wait for the LORD , my whole being waits,<br />
                and in his word I put my hope.<br />
                <sup>6</sup>I wait for the Lord<br />
                more than watchmen wait for the morning,<br />
                more than watchmen wait for the morning.<br />
                <sup>7</sup> Israel, put your hope in the LORD ,<br />
                for with the LORD is unfailing love<br />
                and with him is full redemption.<br />
                <sup>8</sup> He himself will redeem Israel<br />
                from all their sins. <br />

        <p>
            In May the Anglican General Synod passed Motion 20: ”A framework to enhance resilience
            to climate change and disasters by 2025.” Anglicans Climate Action Network Auckland
            invites churches and individuals to join the discussion around climate change by having
            their say on proposed legislation that will shape New Zealand’s climate change action – the
            Zero Carbon Act. If you wish to be involved go the following google doc.

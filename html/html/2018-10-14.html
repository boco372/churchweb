  <sup>23</sup> Jesus looked around and said to his disciples, “How hard it is for the rich to
  enter the kingdom of God!” <sup>24</sup> The disciples were amazed at his words. But
  Jesus said again, “Children, how hard it is <sup>[b]</sup> to enter the kingdom of God! <sup>25</sup> It is
  easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for someone who is
  rich to enter the kingdom of God.”,<br />

  <sup>26</sup> The disciples were even more amazed, and said to each other, “Who then can
  be saved?” <sup>27</sup> Jesus looked at them and said, “With man this is impossible, but
  not with God; all things are possible with God.” <sup>28</sup> Then Peter spoke up, “We
  have left everything to follow you!”<br />

    <sup>29</sup> “Truly I tell you,” Jesus replied, “no one who has left home or brothers or
    sisters or mother or father or children or fields for me and the gospel <sup>30</sup> will fail
    to receive a hundred times as much in this present age: homes, brothers,
    sisters, mothers, children and fields—along with persecutions—and in the age
    to come eternal life. <sup>31</sup> But many who are first will be last, and the last first.” <br />

            <br />
            This ancient Easter greeting heralds the defining story of our faith. In the texts, God’s loving action on our behalf is evident. The gospels point us to the risen Christ. The psalm speaks of God’s promises. Acts and 1 Corinthians proclaim the good news available to all.

                The Resurrection
            </span>
        </strong>
        <br />
        When the Sabbath was over, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of James, and Salome bought spices so that they might go to anoint Jesus’ body. <sup>2</sup> Very early on the first day of the week, just after sunrise, they were on their way to the tomb <sup>3</sup> and they asked each other, “Who will roll the stone away from the entrance of the tomb?”
        <br />
        <br />
        <sup>4</sup> But when they looked up, they saw that the stone, which was very large, had been rolled away. <sup>5</sup> As they entered the tomb, they saw a young man dressed in a white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed.
        <br />
        <br />
        <sup>6</sup> “Don’t be alarmed,” he said. “You are looking for Jesus the Nazarene, who was crucified. He has risen! He is not here. See the place where they laid him. <sup>7</sup> But go, tell his disciples and Peter, ‘He is going ahead of you into Galilee. There you will see him, just as he told you.’”
        <br />
        <br /> 
        <sup>8</sup> Trembling and bewildered, the women went out and fled from the tomb. They said nothing to anyone, because they were afraid.

        FINANCE REPORT TO CONGREGATION
    </strong>
</p>
<ol>
<li>OFFERINGS IN February just above budget and income from rents etc just below.</li>
<li>Expenses were high as the bills for the maintenance done to the grounds of the manse started to arrive. There are more to come including electrical and plumbing work which we did not expect but which has to be done. We will also have the costs of the church buildings annual warrant of fitness to pay. Looking ahead we can expect that our expenses will begin to run over budget.</li>
<li>So far we are managing to avoid drawing on our reserve funds.</li>
<li>OVERALL TIGHT BUT MANAGEABLE. THANKYOU FOR YOUR FAITHFUL SUPPORT AND PRAISE THE LORD!</li>

    An Urgent Call to Prayer. On Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup> April there will be the first call-over of a High Court hearing being held in the Auckland High Court. There are 2 parts to the hearing, with the first being McClintock v Red Beach School Board of Trustees, and the second being McClintock v the Attorney-General.
    <br />
    <span style="font-size: 12.1599998474121px; line-height: 1.3em;">
        Firstly, McClintock is suing the Red Beach School BOT - basically questioning the processes they went through in deciding to keep Religious Instruction at the school (the provider of the programme at this school is 'Values in Action' - CEC is not involved). 
        <br />
    </span>
    Secondly, McClintock is suing the Attorney-General, because he believes that Section 78 of The Education Act 1964 is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights. So in this case the Crown will be the defendant.
    <br />
    The High Court does not have power to change the law, but if the High Court rules that Section 78 is inconsistent with the Bill of Rights, it will then go through the parliamentary process and there is a chance that the law may be changed. A law change will seriously impact on our ability to teach Bible in Schools (or CRE), which is the outcome that the Secular Education Network and McClintock are aiming for. 
    <br />
    CEC have issued a 'Notice of Appearance' in order to become an interested party in this case to ensure we are represented and have a voice. The initial court date of Thursday 23<sup>rd</sup> April is mainly for scheduling purposes. The date for the second hearing will be set at this time.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>
        What we're asking you to do...
    </strong>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">
        Please join with us in prayer over the next few weeks
    </span>
</p>
<ol>We would ask that you please pray specifically for the following key areas:
<li>Firstly that our 'Notice of Appearance' is successful and that CEC becomes an interested party in this case.</li>
<li>Secondly for the lawyers who will be representing CEC (Barrister Ian Bassett and Solicitor Simon Greening). For wisdom and understanding of best processes and action to take on CEC's behalf.</li>
<li>Thirdly, for the provision of finances to fund CEC's involvement in the case. We do not know a specific amount at this point, but costs for a case of this nature can be quite significant.</li>
<li>Finally, that regardless of the outcome that ultimately God's purpose would prevail and that He would use this situation to speak into the lives of all those involved.</li>
</ol>
<p>
    On behalf of CEC I'd like to thank you for taking the time to read this, and ask that you would please forward this information to all those who you think would like to receive it and can stand by us in prayer and financial support. Warm regards, Dominic Hoeft

        Luke 24:36-48 Jesus Appears to His Disciples<br />
        <p>
        <sup>36</sup> While they were still talking about this, Jesus himself stood among them and said to them, “Peace be with you.”
        </p>
        <p>
        <sup>37</sup> They were startled and frightened, thinking they saw a ghost. 
        <sup>38</sup> He said to them, “Why are you troubled, and why do doubts rise in your minds? 
        <sup>39</sup> Look at my hands and my feet. It is I myself! Touch me and see; a ghost does not have flesh and bones, as you see I have.
        </p>
        <sup>40</sup> When he had said this, he showed them his hands and feet. 
        <sup>41</sup> And while they still did not believe it because of joy and amazement, he asked them, “Do you have anything here to eat?” 
        <sup>42</sup> They gave him a piece of broiled fish, 
        <sup>43</sup> and he took it and ate it in their presence.

        English Language Classes
    </strong> 
    run by English Language Partners are free for NZ citizens.
    Currently (Term 1) they have stopped for Term 1. They need a minimum of 12
    students to get full government sponsorship. They currently only have 7, hence the
    prayer call for more students. The teacher is fully trained and really good. These
    classes are friendly, very practical and focus on helping students integrate into NZ
    society. We (St John’s) gain a little financially as they pay a rental for the hours on site,
    but by far the greatest gain is to have the friendly chatter, lots of people learning to
    know St Johns and people coming to church.

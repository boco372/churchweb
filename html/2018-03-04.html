    <strong>Psalm 19 New International Version (NIV)</strong><br />
      <div style='float:left; width:35%'>
        <sup>1</sup>The heavens declare the glory of God;<br />the skies proclaim the work of his hands.<br >
        <sup>2</sup>Day after day they pour forth speech; <br />   night after night they reveal knowledge.<br />
        <sup>3</sup>They have no speech, they use no words;<br />  no sound is heard from them.<br />
        <sup>4</sup>Yet their voice goes out into all the earth,<br />    their words to the ends of the world. <br />In the heavens God has pitched a tent for the sun.<br />
        <sup>5</sup>It is like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,<br />  like a champion rejoicing to run his course.<br />
        <sup>6</sup>It rises at one end of the heavens<br />    and makes its circuit to the other;<br />    nothing is deprived of its warmth.<br />
        <sup>7</sup>The law of the Lord is perfect,<br />    refreshing the soul.<br />The statutes of the Lord are trustworthy,<br />    making wise the simple.<br />
      </div>

      <div style='float:left; width:35%; margin-left:30px'>
        <sup>8</sup>The precepts of the Lord are right,<br />    giving joy to the heart.<br />The commands of the Lord are radiant,<br />    giving light to the eyes.<br />
        <sup>9</sup>The fear of the Lord is pure,<br />    enduring forever.<br />The decrees of the Lord are firm,<br />    and all of them are righteous.<br />
        <sup>10</sup>They are more precious than gold,<br />    than much pure gold;<br />they are sweeter than honey,<br />    than honey from the honeycomb.<br />
        <sup>11</sup>By them your servant is warned;<br />    in keeping them there is great reward.<br />
        <sup>12</sup>But who can discern their own errors?<br />    Forgive my hidden faults.<br />
        <sup>13</sup>Keep your servant also from willful sins;<br />    may they not rule over me.<br />Then I will be blameless,<br />    innocent of great transgression.<br />

<strong>LENT BIBLE STUDY: You are invited to stay after morning worship on Palm Sunday,
25 th March and join in a Bible Study. We will conclude by sharing a light lunch
together.</strong> We will be following the Lectio Divina method of group study. Our passage
will be Mark 14:32-42.
</p>
<p>
  The Lectio Divinia study method below is what we have followed at St Johns previously with
  Chris Skinner:<br >
  <em>
    Choose a significant Gospel passage<br >
    Read passage through out loud (by a good reader)<br >
    After a short time participants speak aloud a key phrase or word that particularly struck
    them. There is no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
    The passage is read again slowly and meaningfully
    In groups of four to six, participants share on the passage and their significant word or
    phrase. Again no comment/questioning/judgment from the other participants
    Return to larger group. Some may wish to share in the larger group. Provide some time for
    this.
  </em>

<p><strong>A MESSAGE FROM THE METHODIST CHURCH</strong></p>
<p>We ask parishes to pray for a moratorium on new oil and gas exploration.</p>
<p>We see <strong>action on climate change</strong> as essential for caring for our common home, and our
global neighbours. Climate justice is part of our commitment to peace and stewarding our
resources responsibly for future generations.</p>
<p>Let us urge the government to refrain from block offers for new oil and gas exploration. We
are concerned that offers for new oil and gas exploration could be made at the Petroleum
Industry Conference 26<sup>th</sup> March.</p>
<p>Please write to Hon Megan Woods, Minister for Energy and Resources, to Prime Minister
Ardern and Hon James Shaw, Minister for Climate Change to request an end to new oil and
gas exploration. A draft letter is being circulated to Parish secretaries.</p>
<p>The <em>Climate Conversations</em> Resource is available as hard copy on the Public Questions
website http://www.methodist.org.nz/public_questions_network/index3</p>

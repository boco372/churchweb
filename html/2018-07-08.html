                            2 Corinthians 12:2-10 New International Version (NIV)
                    </strong>
                </p>
                <sup>2</sup>I know a man in Christ who fourteen years ago was caught up to the third
                heaven. Whether it was in the body or out of the body I do not know—God
                knows. <sup>3</sup> And I know that this man—whether in the body or apart from the body
                I do not know, but God knows— <sup>4</sup> was caught up to paradise and heard
                inexpressible things, things that no one is permitted to tell. <sup>5</sup> I will boast about a
                man like that, but I will not boast about myself, except about my
                weaknesses. <sup>6</sup> Even if I should choose to boast, I would not be a fool, because I
                would be speaking the truth. But I refrain, so no one will think more of me than
                is warranted by what I do or say, <sup>7</sup> or because of these surpassingly great
                revelations. Therefore, in order to keep me from becoming conceited, I was
                given a thorn in my flesh, a messenger of Satan, to torment me. <sup>8</sup> Three times I
                pleaded with the Lord to take it away from me. <sup>9</sup> But he said to me, “My grace is
                sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness.” Therefore I will
                boast all the more gladly about my weaknesses, so that Christ’s power may rest
                on me. <sup>10</sup> That is why, for Christ’s sake, I delight in weaknesses, in insults, in
                hardships, in persecutions, in difficulties. For when I am weak, then I am strong.

                Notice to elect a Nomination Team
        </strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The year has cycled around and we are into the season of the approach of our Annual
General Meeting <strong>(AGM 9 September).</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        The first step towards it is to establish the Nominating Team who are tasked with gathering
        a list of people to serve on the Leadership Team. We will need four people because we
        have the expected rotation loss of members, and two people have left. Lily Han returned to
        China and Jessie Liu is now at university in Australia. Christo John and Lorraine Francis are
        the remaining team. Please prayerfully consider this ministry and who can serve.

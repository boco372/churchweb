<div>Jesus Prays in a Solitary Place</div>
<div>35 Very early in the morning, while it was still dark, Jesus got up, left the house and went off to a solitary place, where he prayed. <sup>36</sup> Simon and his companions went to look for him, <sup>37</sup> and when they found him, they exclaimed: “Everyone is looking for you!” <sup>38</sup> Jesus replied, “Let us go somewhere else—to the nearby villages—so I can preach there also. That is why I have come.” <sup>39</sup> So he travelled throughout Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and driving out demons.<hr /></div>

<hr /><strong>English for Kiwi Life</strong> – Sadly there was insufficient interest in the ‘English as a Second Language’ course which was due to start this week and the organisers have cancelled. The same course was run at St Johns during the second half of 2017. A group of adult students from Russia, China, Korea... participated, some enquiring about St Johns and its services, others expressed interest in what other activities we hold such as Mainly Music. The course was a wonderful outreach into the community and also helped St Johns finances. Please pray for more students so that courses can be held here again. <hr />

<p><strong>Will Science Bury Atheism? Dr Zachary Ardern</strong></p>
<p><em>Does science suggest God does't exist?</em> The natural world is rationally ordered, beautiful, and full of integrated complexity. There are many questions for science and theology to carefully explore and the interaction between them is dynamic and fascinating, and both contribute to human flourishing. But to engage in the conversation we need to get beyond the popular over-simplifications of science. When we do, rather than undermining Christianity - we find it in fact threatens to bury atheism.</p>
<p><strong>At The Forge this month, Dr Zachary Ardern will lead us in an examination that shows how the study of science strongly supports belief in God - and threatens atheism.</strong></p>
<p>When: Wednesday 7 th February, 7 pm – 9 pm Where: Greenlane Christian Centre, 17 Marewa Road, Greenlane Cost: Free – but a Koha to bless the speaker is encouraged.

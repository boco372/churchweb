            Luke 3:15-17 (NIV)
        </strong>
        <br /> 
        <sup>15</sup> The people were waiting expectantly and were all wondering in their hearts if John might possibly be the Messiah. <sup>16</sup> John answered them all, “I baptize you with[a] water. But one who is more powerful than I will come, the straps of whose sandals I am not worthy to untie. He will baptize you with[b] the Holy Spirit and fire. <sup>17</sup> His winnowing fork is in his hand to clear his threshing floor and to gather the wheat into his barn, but he will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire.”

        </strong>
        <br />
         This is the day in our church calendar when we celebrate Jesus’ baptism. It is the day we are encouraged to remember the role baptism has played in our own life. It is a day we are challenged to remember that, along with Jesus, we are beloved by God and empowered to participate in the rebuilding of God’s “kin-dom.”

            Christmas Charity 2015 – What our cash offerings will support.
        </span>
    </strong>
</p>
<p>
    The Leadership Team have determined our Christmas Charity this year is to support Tear Fund. They fund 5 causes: Protect; Sponsor; Restore; Empower; and Nourish. They believe communities have the best solutions to their problems, so they identify local organisations around the world to partner with and empower, to affect positive change. You can go on line and explore more of their work at

    </a>
     Our specific support is for the “Protect” cause of ‘Anti-trafficking and Exploitation’ Tear fund believes people are not commodities so they combat human trafficking to protect people from slavery and exploitation.
</p>
<p>
    A Learn More Fact:
    <br />

</p>
<p>
    Tear Fund says: Human trafficking is organised criminal activity that deceives and coerces people into slavery. The vast majority of victims are vulnerable women and children trapped in poverty, who are robbed of their freedom and dignity.
</p>
<p>
    Tearfund has a deep compassion for the oppressed and a yearning for justice. We believe the exploitation of poor and vulnerable people is a gross injustice that must be confronted.
</p>
<p>
    What we’re doing: 
    <br />
    We take a holistic and comprehensive approach in dealing with human trafficking and exploitation. Through our partners, who are fighting trafficking and slavery in Southern and Southeast Asia, we’re:
</p>
<ul class="style bullet-4">
    <li>Helping to protect people vulnerable to trafficking by running empowerment and education programmes.</li>
    <li>Assisting authorities to break the criminal networks behind trafficking and slavery to set victims free.</li>
    <li>Working with local law enforcement to help prosecute the traffickers and brothel owners to prevent further people from becoming enslaved.</li>
    <li>Giving survivors a safe place to heal and recover, and restoring their dignity through rehabilitation.</li>
</ul>
<ul class="style bullet-4">
    More Facts
    <li>1 – 2% The number of victims that are ever rescued</li>
    <li>22% Of 21 million people enslaved in the world are sexually exploited</li>
    <li>Without demand for pornography or prostitution there would be no sex trafficking</li>
    <li>12 years Is the average age of a victim of sexual trafficking and this is getting younger</li>

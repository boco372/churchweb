    <sup>28</sup>One of the teachers of the law came and heard them debating. Noticing that
    Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments,
    which is the most important?”<br />
    <sup>29</sup>“The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel: The Lord
    our God, the Lord is one. <sup>30</sup> Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with
    all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’ <sup>31</sup> The second is
    this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than
    these.”<br />
    <br />
    <sup>32</sup>“Well said, teacher,” the man replied. “You are right in saying that God is one
    and there is no other but him. <sup>33</sup> To love him with all your heart, with all your
    understanding and with all your strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself is
    more important than all burnt offerings and sacrifices.”<br />
    <sup>34</sup> When Jesus saw that he had answered wisely, he said to him, “You are not
    far from the kingdom of God.” And from then on no one dared ask him any
    more questions.<br />

			<h3>Worship</h3>
<p>Worship is the foundation of our life at St. Johns. We seek to offer a blend of worship styles which enable people from a range of ages and backgrounds to participate easily. </p>
<p><strong>Sundays </strong></p>
<p>At present we have one morning worship service at 9.30am. Ministries for children are offered at the same time. Holy Communion is offered on the 1<sup>st</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> Sundays of each month. Once a quarter we offer a Communion Service in the Presbyterian style. </p>
<h4>Children's and Youth Ministries</h4>
<p><strong>Children</strong><strong>’</strong><strong>s Church </strong></p>
<p>Meets Sundays at 9.30am in the upstairs hall during school term time.</p>
<p><strong>Little Acorns</strong> (Pre-schoolers)</p>
<p>Meets Sundays at 9.30am in the uostairs hall during school term time.</p>
<p><strong>The Club (</strong>Youth - intermediate and college age)</p>
<p>Friday nights at 7.30pm.</p>
<h3>Pastoral Care</h3>
<p>At St. Johns we consider pastoral care and outreach to be an important part of our mission. In addition to our staff team, we have a network of people who offer practical care and support, emergency assistance as required, visiting of the lonely or those whose circumstances prevent them from leaving home very often, keeping in contact by visits or telephone and transport to medical appointments etc. </p>
<p>Initial contact for those in need should be either through the Administrator at the office (535 2305), or direct to the Minister.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Prayer</h3>
<p>We believe that our life and ministry at St. Johns must be based on prayer and we see God at work building and guiding our church life as we pray. </p><ul><li>Prayer ministry is available after each service. </li><li>Each Tuesday and Thursday (12.30-1.30pm) a group of people meet in the chapel to pray for the parish and for the needs of persons or situations as requested. Any are welcome to join in this time of prayer. Particular prayer requests can be made either by phoning the Administrator or the Minister at the office (534 2305). </li><li>A prayer chain is available for emergency needs. </li></ul><h3>Communion</h3>
<p>All who are baptised are welcome at the Lord's Table including children. </p>
<p>We offer a short course of teaching for children and Admission to the Lord's Supper. However, we do accept children receiving the Communion before this has happened. </p>
<p>Both grape juice and wine are offered at Communion. </p>
<h3>Baptism</h3>
<p>We baptise children on their parents' confession of faith and appreciate the opportunity to do some baptism preparation with the family beforehand. </p>
<p>We also offer baptism of young people and adults on profession of faith.</p>
<p>A Ministry of Renewal of Baptismal Promises for those already baptised is also available.</p>
<p>Dedication of children, if preferred, is also offered. </p>
<h3>Confirmation</h3>
<p>The opportunity to formally confirm one's baptism by profession of faith and to be confirmed in the faith will be offered for adults and young people, usually once a year. </p>
<h3>Weddings</h3>
<p>Our church is always open to those wishing to be married. We believe that Christian marriage is one of the most wonderful of human relationships created by God. </p>
<p>We take seriously a request to be married. We ask that any couple wishing to be married intend to establish their marriage on the Christian principles of mutual unconditional love, respect, honesty and life-long commitment. </p>
<h3>Funerals</h3>
<p>We believe that Christian funeral services are best conducted in a church environment. We therefore encourage families, relatives and friends to make appropriate arrangements so that the church becomes the place where the service is held. Our pastoral team seeks to offer good follow-up for the bereaved. </p>

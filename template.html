<div>
 
4 Rejoice in the Lord always. I will say it again: Rejoice! <sup>5</sup> Let your gentleness be evident
to all. The Lord is near. <sup>6</sup> Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by
prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. <sup>7</sup> And the peace of
God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ
Jesus. <sup>8</sup> Finally, brothers and sisters, whatever is true, whatever is noble, whatever is
right, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is admirable—if anything is
excellent or praiseworthy—think about such things. <sup>9</sup> Whatever you have learned or
received or heard from me, or seen in me—put it into practice. And the God of peace
will be with you.
Thanks for Their Gifts
<sup>10</sup> I rejoiced greatly in the Lord that at last you renewed your concern for me. Indeed,
you were concerned, but you had no opportunity to show it. <sup>11</sup> I am not saying this
because I am in need, for I have learned to be content whatever the circumstances. <sup>12</sup> I
know what it is to be in need, and I know what it is to have plenty. I have learned the
secret of being content in any and every situation, whether well fed or hungry, whether
living in plenty or in want. <sup>13</sup> I can do all this through him who gives me strength.</div>

<strong>CHRISTIAN BROADCASTING AT CHRISTMAS - 30 Hours Airtime on three networks –
Newstalk ZB, Radio Sport and RadioLIVE</strong> have entrusted their airwaves to Christian
Broadcastings’ talented team of presenters, to retell the Christmas story in a multitude of
creative and compelling ways.
<br>
This Christmas Eve from 7 pm on RadioLIVE, Judy Bailey takes listeners on a nostalgic
journey to explore the essence of a Kiwiana Christmas. We hear tales of everything from
Father Christmas parachuting into the Auckland Domain to New Zealand’s very first Christmas service at Oihi Bay in 1814 when Samuel Marsden proclaimed “Te Harinui” – glad tiding of great joy – the Good News.
